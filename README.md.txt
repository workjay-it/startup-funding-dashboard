# Crunchbase Venture Funding Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes startup funding patterns, investor activity,
and acquisition behavior using Crunchbase-style datasets.
The goal is to understand how capital flows through the startup ecosystem
and how funding relates to company outcomes.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)
- DuckDB (SQL analytics engine)
- DBeaver (SQL IDE)

## Datasets
- Companies
- Funding Rounds
- Investments
- Acquisitions

All datasets were cleaned, re-encoded to UTF-8, and analyzed using
SQL joins based on company permalinks.

## Key Questions
- Which companies raised the most funding?
- How has startup funding evolved over time?
- Which investors are the most active?
- Do companies that acquire others have higher funding?

## Key Insights
- Startup funding is highly concentrated among a small number of companies
- Late-stage funding rounds account for most capital raised
- Investor activity follows a power-law distribution
- Acquiring companies tend to have higher average funding levels

## Skills Demonstrated
- Real-world data cleaning & encoding fixes
- SQL joins and aggregations across multiple tables
- DuckDB database management
- Python data visualization
- Analytical storytelling
